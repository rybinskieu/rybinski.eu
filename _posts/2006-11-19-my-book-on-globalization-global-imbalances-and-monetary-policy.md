I have just finished my book on globalization, unfortunately for my non-Polish friends it is in Polish (available on my blog until it is published). Below you may find the list of chapters. I should be able to provide English translation sometime in the future. My book summarizes few hundred most important academic papers on various aspects of globalization and monetary policy published in the last few years
