### Lighter, but relevant reading

  * Will US become bigger oil producer than Saudi Arabia, read NYT [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/business/21shale.html?ex=1324357200&amp;en=f216b9571ed07ab1&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss) on shale oil experiments. There are still some tehcnical problems left, such as high carbon dioxide emissions, which contributes to green house effect. But watch out, US shale oil, Candian sands and recent nuclear energy projects gain momentum, so those emprires built on oil could find themselves on shaky foundations in a couple of years.
