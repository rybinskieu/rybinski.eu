  * Morgan Stanley’s Steven Roach [writes](http://www.morganstanley.com/views/gef/archive/2007/20070316-Fri.html) about Greenspan bubble legacy, and speculates whether the not to distant future will write the missing chapter about modern central banking, a quote: “The exit strategy is painfully simple: Ultimately, it is up to Ben Bernanke – and whether he has both the wisdom and the courage to break the daisy chain of the “Greenspan put.” If he doesn’t, I am convinced that this liquidity-driven era of excesses and imbalances will ultimately go down in history as the outgrowth of a huge failure for modern-day central banking. In the meantime, prepare for the downside – spillover risks are bound to intensify as yet another post-bubble shakeout unfolds.”
  * Morgan Stanley Steven Jen [writes](http://www.morganstanley.com/views/gef/archive/2007/20070316-Fri.html#anchor4580) about the consequences of emergence of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). 
  * The Economist [article](http://www.morganstanley.com/views/gef/archive/2007/20070316-Fri.html#anchor4580) on global imbalances, inconclusive, as every other article dealing with such topic.
  * Bloomberg [quotes](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aV.nCIgJbwvc&refer=home) Chine premier Wen Jiabao speaking unsutainable Chinese growth. The key risk appears that China will … accelerate and disequlibria will deteriorate even more.
