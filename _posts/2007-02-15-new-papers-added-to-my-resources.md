I have added several new papers to my [resources](http://www.rybinski.eu/resources/index.php) today. There is growing amount of research showing that demographic factors are becoming increasingly important (affect world real interest rates, affect German growth pattern, an much more). Many people would argue that if demographic changes are predicted in 20 or 40 years it is too far away to matter, but I would argue that expectations of these developments may be affecting choices and preferences today.
