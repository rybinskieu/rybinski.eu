The World Bank has just issued a [report](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTECA/Resources/257896-1167856389505/Migration_FullReport.pdf) on migration and remittances in our region. I have not read the report yet, but experts drew my attention to the fact that migration figures for Poland may be overstated. I have written about migration several [times](http://www.rybinski.eu/?p=380&language=en) on this blog and in my book and I think that it will become much more important economic force in the next few years (decades) than most people expect today. I will comment on the WB report later this week.
