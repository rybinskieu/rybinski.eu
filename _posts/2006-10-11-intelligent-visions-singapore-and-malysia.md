While Europe is trying to revive its “zombie” Lisbon Agenda and spends half of its common budget subsidizing farmers, other countries are moving fast forward. Take a look at two examples:

  * Singapore created an intelligent nation vision 2015 and is striving to become number 1 infocomm place in the world, thus adding value to economy and society, check [here](http://www.in2015.sg/goals.html) and [here](http://www.ida.gov.sg/idaweb/aboutida/index.jsp) 
  * In Malaysia two intelligent cities have been built, [Putrajaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putrajaya) and Cyberjaya

Our future will be shaped by (wireless) information and communication technology, and it will happen much faster than most people imagine today. It will require new skills, young generation will posess those skills as they speak Internet and mobile as native tongues, older generation will have to adapt. Having a blog is the best way to actively experience this inevitable, upcoming change.
