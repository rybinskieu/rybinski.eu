### Lighter, but relevant reading

  * Serious security flaws found in new Microsoft Windows VISTA, read NYT [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/25/technology/25vista.html?ei=5088&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;en=49a6fdd42da8e302&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ex=1324702800&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;adxnnl=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;emc=rss&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;adxnnlx=1167073874-ncuWyoVU6Ilv2IjnpHd6jw)
  * How was your bonus this year? Check Wall Street bonuses spending season, IHT [article](http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/12/25/business/bonus.php)
  * Chinese car manufacturers to challenge US, European and Japanese giants. This is already an old story, how about aircraft. Take a look at China daily [article](http://english.people.com.cn/200612/23/eng20061223_335305.html). 
  * China and Japan formed a joint committee to enhance mutual understanding of objective history, see China daily [article](http://english.people.com.cn/200612/21/eng20061221_334758.html). History and politics are obstacles slowing the process of Asian economic and monetary integration, so progress on this front is very welcome. I do believe that Asia common currency (ASEAN+3) will be created before 2030.
  * Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales is planning to challenge Google and Yahoo! (who jointly account for 75% of internet searches), see Times [article](http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9075-2517026,00.html). The name of the new, social, search engine will be Wikiasari. 
  * Can oil revenues spending lead to inflation, see Gulfnews [article](http://archive.gulfnews.com/business/Economy/10091993.html) on Iran. Look at the biggest ever spending budget in Saudi Arabia, Gulfnews [article](http://archive.gulfnews.com/business/Comment_and_Analysis/10091924.html). And by the way, are you amazed by 10% growth in China, how abut 21.8% year on year growth in [Oman](http://archive.gulfnews.com/business/Economy/10091817.html). 
  * This [page](http://mashable.com/2006/12/24/top-social-networks-2006/) covers all important social networks with descriptions, indicates ones that can become hits in 2007. The web 2.0 place is getting crowded indeed.
