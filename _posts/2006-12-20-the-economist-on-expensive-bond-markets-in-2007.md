The Economist buttonwood section tells a [story](http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8459490) that the really big test for bond markets is ahead of us, possibly in 2007, and that spreads are too tight. The bottomline of the article is that emerging market debt and corporate debt markets may suffer and that “_the entire asset class of bonds is characterised by symptoms of overvaluation and complacency_“.
