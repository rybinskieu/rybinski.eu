I have argued for some time that global inflation and global financial stability risks call for emergence of global central bank. It seems that this view is shared by monetary policy guru – John Taylor, author of famous Taylor rule – who argues in his recent [paper](http://www.rybinski.eu/resources/non-modules.d/dispatcher/dispatch.php?id=2332) that global monetary policy coordination is welfare enhancing, and that global monetary policy should focus on price stability.
