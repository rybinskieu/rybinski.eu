Financial Times has a special insert today focused on Poland: “[One nation: three realities](http://www.ft.com/reports/poland2006) “. These realities are:

  * one reality is peopled by politicians and journalists obsessed with Warsaw and its political crises, sex and bribery scandals;
  * second reality is a booming modern big city retail malls, where well dressed people wander through shops;
  * the third Poland, according to FT, is found in the run-down blocks or flats and small towns and villages, where low paid or unemployed struggle to pay their bills, and look with discontent into Poland one and two.
