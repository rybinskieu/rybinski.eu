I have just published a concept note that introduces the new framework for modern monetary policy. This new framework is much more effective in stimulating growth, does not lead to inflationary pressures and does not lead to pathological outcomes which were caused by zero interest rate and QE policy. Paper is available [here](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2519210).
