In my capacity as the rector of the University of Economics and Computer Science  I am looking for a  person or two people  to manage several projects run by UECS and to prepare EU funds applications. The following competences are required:

- fluent English and Polish

- proven track record of winning EU funds tenders in the field of higher education

- proven track record of successful managing projects under tight deadlines (preferred Prince 2 methodology, but others can be considered as well).

Preferred candidate will have both skills, but I will also consider two separate positions. UECS offers success-based competitive compensation.

Applications not exceeding two pages should be sent to:

<rektorat@wsei.pl>

Job opens asap.
