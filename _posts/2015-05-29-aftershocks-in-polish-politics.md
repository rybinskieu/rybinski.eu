Last Sunday Poland chose new president, 43 years old Andrzej Duda, who was unknown to Poles six months ago. But with the support of the main opposition party he did win. The third in the race was a rock star [Pawel Kukiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJJr68FbFXM). Two weeks later, Kukiz shows up in ranking and the most trustworthy politician and his new party comes second in opinion polls, PiS with 36 percent, Kukiz with 25 percent, ahead of ruling PO with 20 percent.

During the first two years of PO ruling I believed they wanted to change the country for the better. I advised four ministers in PO government and coauthored many strategic documents. But it was all fake, PO leadership did not care. I soon understood that there will be no real reforms, that it is only about the power and nepotism. I wrote more than 200 articles in Polish newspapers and one book warning about PO government, including the worst finance minister in the history of Poland, you know who. Nobody listened, or very few. Then the tapes came out and people found out the real face of PO. And finally, the nation woke up and gave PO the thumbs down.

Of course PO will fight, they are scared that the truth about Smolensk will see the daylight, as five members of the [ZEN](http://www.rybinski.eu/2011/02/zespol-ekspertow-niezaleznych-zen/) wrote in the [article](http://wpolityce.pl/polityka/112259-rybinski-skrzypczak-petelicki-gula-i-gomola-domagaja-sie-trybunalu-stanu-dla-tuska) in Rzeczpospolita in the first anniversary of the tragedy.

But it is the past. Hopefully villains will be prosecuted and punished. But the more important is the future. Every change begins with hope, that new elites will create new, powerful vision of Poland, that meets the aspirations of the nation. PiS has managed to create a strong group of experts, many of them young, well educated, who have been discussing the future of Poland in the past few years and designing new reform, under the brand [Last Sunday Poland chose new president, 43 years old Andrzej Duda, who was unknown to Poles six months ago.

So ideas are ready, team is prepared. As we all know the most important year is 2016, first year after elections. Later, starting from 2018 demographic tsunami will hit Poland hard, so reforms will have to be fast and well designed.

Lets hope the new elites after winning 2015 presidential and general electionsÂ  will use their window of opportunity wisely. Polish nation should no longer hear the PO narrative that our biggest chance are handouts from Brussels. Our biggest strength should be powerful vision and leadership, our talent, our entrepreneurship DNA developed in the past 500 years and our resolve to become the great nation that we once were.

The time has come. Now or never.
