I was invited to speak at this year edition ofÂ  [TEDxWarsaw](http://tedxwarsaw.com/speakers/), 24 March, Centrum Nauki Kopernik in Warsaw.

I will show in less than 12 minutes how to turn Poland into the most innovative country in the world in less than one year.

Do not miss this opportunity. There is a great selection of speakers, who can inspire you.
