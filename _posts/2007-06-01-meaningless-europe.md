I have added to my resources the [presentation](http://www.rybinski.eu/resources/non-modules.d/dispatcher/dispatch.php?id=2277) I offered to participants of the conference “The Future of Europe”. I call for a new vision of Europe, to avoid a scenario, in which Europe becomes Argentina of the XXI century. Take a look, there are interesting data, and presentation is self-explanatory. The size of the PowerPoint file is 6MB.

Comments are most welcome.
