International Herald Tribune [blog](http://blogs.iht.com/tribtalk/business/globalization/?p=177) asked several questions to Joseph Stiglitz, economics Nobel Prize winner, questions relate to challenges of globalization.

Here are few paragraphs related to China:

“…China will have an impact on almost every country in the world, rich or poor, small or large, but its impacts will differ markedly from country to country. Overall, I believe that growth is positive sum, not zero-sum: China’s growth benefits not only the citizens of China, but contributes to a strong global economy. Many around the world benefit from the inexpensive goods it produces; China’s large purchases abroad have benefited many producers around the world; and competition from China has kept inflation in check, and that has allowed Central Banks to maintain lower interest rates than they otherwise would have had; and that too has contributed to strong global growth.

But the impacts are varied. China’s rapid growth has been contributing to high commodity prices, which have been enormous benefit to the producers of these commodities, but imposed additional costs on competing users. Many factories both in the advanced industrial countries and in developing countries have found that they cannot compete; factories have been shut down and workers face unemployment, or, when they do get another job, lower wages.

Small economies both are more vulnerable and face more opportunities. They are more vulnerable, because they are often less diversified, and an industry in which they have specialized can be wiped out almost overnight. But they face more opportunities, because if they find a niche in which China has a strong demand, their prospects may be very bright. Parts of Ethiopia are doing so much better today than they have in the past, because China has begun to buy sesame seeds…”

The question about globalization impact on ([global](/uploads/ecb_global_inflation.pdf) ) inflation in recent 1-20 years remains open. Was it globalization, or emergence of China or Richard Freeman “[great doubling](/uploads/freeman_on_great_doubling.pdf) ” of the labor force, or was is better monetary policy executed by independent central banks.
