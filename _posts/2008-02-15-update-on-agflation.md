I keep watching new data that will allow better assessment of food prices in the coming years. Here is some recent news:

  * FAO [I keep watching new data that will allow better assessment of food prices in the coming years. Here is some recent news:

  * FAO](http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2008/1000784/index.html) that further increase of tea prices should be expected
  * FAO [reposts](http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2008/1000783/index.html) that despite expected significant increase in world cereal production prices will remain at record levels, and some will continue to rise
  * FAO started [new world food situation portal](http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/) , that covers short-term and long term food market prospects.
  * And here is a [brief summary](http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ah881e/ah881e05.htm) of few indicators showing that further increase in grain prices is possible, unless we have a very good 2008, especially for wheat
  * It is also worth reading a very i[nteresting summary of food prices prospects](http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ah876e/ah876e13.htm) , which cites speculation activity, rising dry cargo prices (indeed [Baltic Dry index](http://www.investmenttools.com/futures/bdi_baltic_dry_index.htm) is heading North again), there is also a list of major world foodstuffs producers with dates of major crops coming.
