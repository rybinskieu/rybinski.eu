I subscribed to MIT [Technology Review](http://www.technologyreview.com/) and I found the following very interesting [article](http://www.technologyreview.com/printer_friendly_article.aspx?id=17932) about questions and answers services available on the web.

It appears that Yahoo Answers is best at tapping the wisdom of the crowd, which is based on a rule that everybody knows a lot about something, and that knowledge can be useful to someone else.

In XX century you became a professor when you published a lot in refereed journals, wrote several books, spent time coaching future PhDs. On the oldest QandA service, [AnswerBag](http://www.answerbag.com) you become a professor when your answers to posted questions are ranked very high.

I just cannot stop thinking how different XXI century will be from XX century, and that old generation (one that keep all political jobs) fails to understand these changes.
