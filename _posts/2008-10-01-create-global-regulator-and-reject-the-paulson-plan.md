You can find below two links to my letters published by the Financial Times, they explain why Paulson plan is a bad idea and that we need a global solution to US problems, we need a global central bank.

I also have few copies of my book (in English) Gordian knots of the 21st century that explains it in more detail I can mail copies to interested readers, leave a comment to get a copy.
