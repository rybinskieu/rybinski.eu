On page 90 of the recent [ECB monthly](http://www.rybinski.eu/resources/non-modules.d/dispatcher/dispatch.php?id=2255) is a box which takes a brief look at the globalization – inflation link. It shows that the share of imports from low-cost countries has risen fat in the past decade, from 40 to 50 percent, and that in Q4’2006 this process accelerated. Import prices from low-cost destinations stopped falling, but it is attributed by ECB mostly to rising energy prices. Conclusion, globalization continues to put downward pressure on eurozone prices.
