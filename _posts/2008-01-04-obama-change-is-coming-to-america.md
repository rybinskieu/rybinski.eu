Barack Obama won Iowa scoring 38% of the vote, ahead of 30% for John Edwards and 29% for Hillary Clinton. He is becoming a leading Democratic candidate for US President. Among Republicans Huckabee took 34% of the vote.

Note that Obama scored 57% of the vote among people under 30. In his speech (link is below) he said:

“The change is coming to America”.

It is coming indeed, and the young people, plus the huge bloggers’ support may make a difference, and may help choose first ever black US president this November. This will be a truly symbolic change. 

I know close to nothing about Obama. But I think we should all watch him very closely now and learn what he is up to. He might be a symbol of global political earthquake, that will shape the 21st century politics.
