Paul Krugman wrote an [article](http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/03/paul_krugman_th.html) (courtesy of Mark Thoma blog) as of March 2008 looking back one year and analyzing roots of meltdown that started one year earlier. Nouriel Roubini presents evidence in his [blog](http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/181123) that hard landing recession in US lies ahead.

Few years ago, wearing commercial bank chief economist hat I did a trick similar to Paul Krugmanâ€™s. I spoke during the commercial banks congress and I pretended that it was five years later and my speech was titled why the crisis had happened and had it been possible to avoid it? I received excellent feedback, people did like the speech, it got some publicity. But guess what? I was wrong. There was economic slowdown, but crisis never happended.
