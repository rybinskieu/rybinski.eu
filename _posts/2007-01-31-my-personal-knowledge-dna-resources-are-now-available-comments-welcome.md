When I started my blog few month ago I planned three steps:

  * step 1: regular blog on global economic issues, intellectual capital, e-economy and monetary policy;
  * step 2: making my resources public, using tags;
  * step 3: using wiki technology to launch several research projects in open source technology

Few days ago step 2 was completed and now you can go to resources on my blog to find few thousand papers that I read (of fast-read) in the last eighteen months. You may ask how it is possible that central bank deputy governor finds time to read so many papers, this is good question for another post. I am planning to write about XXI century knowledge worker (which applies to central bankers) and my vision how this worker will have to function. But today I would like to invite you to share with me your thoughts about my step 2. Is it a good idea, do you like my resources and tags, what would you change, etc.

Finally, I have published my “personal knowledge DNA” (copyright goes to Jan Gorski, founder of Plum). You can see my inbound tags and outbound tags. I believe that this will help to shape the new standard of the XXI century knowledge worker. In my vision within next 5-10 years many knowledge workers (consultants, academics, engineers, etc) will have public personal knowledge DNA. This will help to form communities, will help to share knowledge and will help to accelerate innovation process. Get ready for an unprecented period of innovation progress.

I also want to share with you some views on the young generation (I am turning forty soon, but I feel young and want to understand the young generation). New generation, which is in teens today, is always online. They make friends globally, are very open, are used to sharing knowledge, feelings and express themselves in a very direct, honest way. They have avatars, and their avatars have friends. They use internet as main source of information, knowledge and respect (you are respected when your blog is cool). They are incredibly fast.
  
We, the old generation, have two choices. Either we will require that new generation behaves according to XX century rules, which will be rejected, or we will try to understand them and talk their “language”. Blogging and SMS-ing is part of the young generation language (when my wife niece visited us last week – she is fifteen, – within one hour she talked about her school, logged into her blog to check new comments and sent few SMS. This is a really fast generation indeed. 

I stop here. Please do give me your feed-back about my resources. I am planning to open my resources in the future such that others will be able to add their papers and tags, modify existing tags, add comments, etc. The papers were automatically uploaded, so tags are not perfect, they were derived from file names I used. Upload data was last modified in December, but I am going to add January-read papers soon and keep adding new papers as soon as I read or fast-read them.
