I am scheduled to speak at the [international conference](http://www.wcb.eitplus.com/artykuly/426/Programm/) on European research that will be held in Wroclaw on 4th September 2009, see also my earlier post below. I prepared a speech inspired by the famous Sir Winston Churchill speech “Blood, sweat and tears”. My speech is [here](http://www.rybinski.eu/resources/non-modules.d/dispatcher/dispatch.php?id=2380). Comments most welcome.
