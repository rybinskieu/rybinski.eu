The most important election in the world is over. USA has a new president Donald Trump. It will probably mean the following economic policies are implemented:

- lower taxes and, in the short-term higher public debt

- more spending on infrastructure, which US badly needs and higher military spending

- less globalization and more protectionist measures, such as tariffs and physical/legal obstacles to inward labor mobility. many policies will be targeted to slow China rise as new economic power, including declaring China a currency manipulator

- developing better economic relations with Russia, and at the same time advance US cybersecurity capacity to neutralize both Russia and China

- increasing incomes for poorest Americans, for example by higher minimum wage and tax credit

- changing the Fed chair, but continuing the policy of low interest rates

- destroying ISIS with more determination than so far, including new measures in the US (legal, intelligence and military)

- more investments in American energy sector, that could lead to further lowering of oil prices

Good summary of Trump proposals is [here](https://www.politiplatform.com/trump).

These policies are challenged by economists that support Democrats and by those who believe benefits of further globalization outweigh costs such as higher income disparity. I also believe that contrary to consensus forecast it means strong dollar as major global policy change increases risks and it leads to more investment is safe currencies. In short-term stocks will go down from already well overpriced levels.

It is now clear that globalization as we knew it in the past few decades is over. De-globalization, already under way, will accelerate.

Now it is time for many people to read Dani Rodrik (one of my favorite economists) 1997 book “[Has globalization gone too far?](http://bookstore.piie.com/book-store/57.html)” (free download). Already 20 years ago he wrote that too much globalization would lead to social disintegration, bad economics and bad governance.
