Ernst and Young and IBnGR prepared the Higher Education Strategy 2020 for Poland on the request of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education. English language translation of the strategy is [here](http://resources.rybinski.eu/resources/viewResource:cf5fbe3c-1c83-11df-98d8-001b24eff4d8).

Comments are very welcome. Final version of the strategy will be presented to the ministry after the consultation process and after the evaluation by reputed British institute specializing in higher education issues.
