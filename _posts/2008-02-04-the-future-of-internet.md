The future of internet is shaped today, and with the Microsoft takeover of Yahoo! it is gaining a new speed. Two giants: Microsoft and Google have already exchanged very hostile blog posts, see:

Google [attacking](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/yahoo-and-future-of-internet.html) Microsoft monopoly culture and Microsoft [response](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/feb08/02-03Statement.mspx?rss_fdn=Press%20Releases) saying that Google itself is a monopoly.

Get ready, the ball is rolling.
