  * NYT [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/technology/circuits/04pogue.html?_r=1&ex=1349323200&en=31523e7ea63a911f&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin) on XO laptop launch in November, with amazing features costing only $200. Quote:

“

In November, you’ll be able to buy a new laptop that’s spillproof, rainproof, dustproof and drop-proof. It’s fanless, it’s silent and it weighs 3.2 pounds. One battery charge will power six hours of heavy activity, or 24 hours of reading. The laptop has a built-in video camera, microphone, memory-card slot, graphics tablet, game-pad controllers and a screen that rotates into a tablet configuration.”

Interesting. In Poland some telecoms are offering laptop for 1 PLN (50 cents) but you have to use their services. Well, in 3rd world countries you will have to pay famous 100 bucks  for a computer, in more developed countries you get it for free, like cell phones
