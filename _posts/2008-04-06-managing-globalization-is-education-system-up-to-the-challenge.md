Demos Europa and Danish embassy in Poland organize a seminar on Monday. Both countries education ministers will make speeches and then we will have a debate titled: “Managing globalization – is education system up to the challenge?”.

My speech is [here](http://www.rybinski.eu/resources/non-modules.d/dispatcher/dispatch.php?id=2335) . The short answer is “NO”. European education system (and Polish in particular) needs deep reform to be able to face challenges posed by globalization. I put some good stories in my speech to illustrate the point.

Comments are very welcome.
