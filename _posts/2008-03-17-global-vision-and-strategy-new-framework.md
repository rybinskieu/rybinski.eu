I am writing a book on global problems. One is the lack of the world vision. Part of chapter 2 is [here](/uploads/strategic_political_choice_17_march_2008.pdf) . It is very, very controversial but it was planned to be that way. It is also preliminary, with links and references yet to be added. But I would love to read your comments at this very early stage. I am bringing the practices of the world of finance into the world of politics, please let me know whether it makes any sense. Will German eat French, and what will they drink for this delicious dinner? Check the answer.
