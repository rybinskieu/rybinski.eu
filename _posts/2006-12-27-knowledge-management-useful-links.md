My personal research interests are gradually shifting away from pure economics to knowledge management / intellectual capital, with heavy emphasis on the web 2.0 support for knowledge sharing and knowledge creation. Why? I think that XXI century will be the knowledge century, and knowledge sharing and creation will become most important business processes. Companies that will fail to create supportive knowledge sharing environment will not survive. Those who doubt what I have just said are invited to visit the [list of 100 new global challengers](/uploads/bcg_on_new_global_companies.pdf) created by BCG. 

I thought I would leave a list of useful links for my (and others) future reference:

  * Intellectual capital [definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_capital) from Wikipedia 
  * Knowledge management [definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management) , from Wikipedia

  * Knowledge Auctions – e.g. [Knexa.com](http://www.knexa.com/)
  * Knowledge Shops or Malls – e.g. [KnowledgeShop](http://www.knowledgeshop.com/)
  * Question and Answer Exchanges – e.g. [Keen.com](http://www.keen.com/)
  * Intellectual Property Exchanges – [Yet2.com](http://www.yet2.com/), [Patent and Licence Exchange](http://www.pl-x.com/)
  * E-learning exchanges – [Emind](http://www.emind.com/)[My personal research interests are gradually shifting away from pure economics to knowledge management / intellectual capital, with heavy emphasis on the web 2.0 support for knowledge sharing and knowledge creation.

I borrowed this list from [skyrme](http://www.skyrme.com/insights/28kmkt.htm). The post was created in 2001, so I was surprised to find that almost all links led to still functioning companies. It appears that KM/WEB2.0 activity has higher survival rate that other internet-based activities.
