CESifo, a Munich based think-tank has presented its sixth [report](http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page?_pageid=36,286932&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL) on European Economy. CESifo also made available [database](http://www.cesifo.de/DICE) with wide range of indicators, which can be very useful for comparative purposes.
