  * Former Fed Chairman [says](http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-02-26-greenspan_x.htm) US recession is possible in 2007. Quote: “When you get this far away from a recession, invariably forces build up for the next recession, and indeed we are beginning to see that sign,” Greenspan said via satellite link to a business conference in Hong Kong. “For example in the U.S., profit margins … have begun to stabilize, which is an early sign we are in the later stages of a cycle.” [...]. “While, yes, it is possible we can get a recession in the latter months of 2007, most forecasters are not making that judgment and indeed are projecting forward into 2008 … with some slowdown,”.

  * Cetral Banking Publications polled 47 reserves managers, reporting after [Bank of New York](https://gm.bankofny.com/Research/MorningUpdate/Default.aspx?ReadMore=Yes&ContentManagerID=5970) : <p class="MsoNormal">
      “A poll by Central Banking Publications of official reserve managers at 47 central banks (controlling around USD 1.5 Trn in assets) shows that 85% see scope for further currency and asset diversification of foreign exchange reserves. According to Reuters the poll also shows that many are also keen to invest more of their reserves into higher-yielding and “non-traditional” assets such as stocks and commodities. One reserve manager from an industrialised country says: “Globally, it would not be surprising to see a continued shift away from USD-denominated reserves.” Another notes: “Central banks are moving away from a purely conservative way of managing reserves to a somewhat more aggressive type, simply because they have begun to master the best practices of asset and wealth management.” Twenty-one respondents say that they increased the weighting of the EUR in their reserves. 68% said they were concerned about growing risks from global imbalances. An Asian manager also notes: “Fund flows and activities associated with hedge funds continue to be the focus since their leverage capacity and increased flows will increase the market volatility in traditional asset markets.”
