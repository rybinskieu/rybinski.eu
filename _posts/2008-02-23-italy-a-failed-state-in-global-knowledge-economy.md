I was not able to blog in the past week. I went to Italy with my family for skiing to Molveno, which is a very nice city located on the shore of Lago Molveno and very close to nice slopes of Paganella. Great weather, great food, great fun. Highly recommended. But …

In Molveno four star hotel did not offer Wi-Fi service. You have to pay 15 euro for one hour internet access, and when I tried there was a musem-style computer with no “@” sign on the keyboard. In Poland even one-star bed and breakfasts often offer Wi-Fi access for free. Now I understand much better why Italy is again in recession. It has no chance to do well in 21st century global knowledge economy unless Italians change their mentality. Of course Italians do enjoy their great food and life, for the time being …

Prime Minister co-signed my resignation last week signed earlier by President, so I am a free man now (released from central bank deputy governor post), which is a nice way of saying that I am temporarily unemployed. Not for long, I am sure. From now I will blog regularly, until I go to Italy next time  <img src='http://www.rybinski.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
