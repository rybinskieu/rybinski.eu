Willem Buiter and Anne Sibert [argue](http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/459) that central banks should perform the function of the market-makers of the last resort at times when markets fail to function properly (such as in recent days). It confirms my own view presented in the previous [post](http://www.rybinski.eu/?p=517&language=en). One difference, I think that this role should be played by large holders of reserve assets, which happen to be emerging market central banks and SWFs.
