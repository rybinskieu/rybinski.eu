There is a wild party, a long one. Every time alcohol supply dries up central bank shows up and keeps the party going and going, and people get more and more addicted to partying and drinking. At some stage premises are demolished and party is over. Paul and Ben show up and ask who did the most damage. John, people say, he broke four windows and crashed the table. Great says Paul, John will get 300 dollars, who is next on the did-most-damage list. Tim, crowd cries, he put a spray all over the place and burned the sofa. Excellent goes Paul, Tim will get 250 dollars. Who is next …
  
In a few days the next party will begin. People are planning to show up in large numbers, not only they can have a lot of fun (while others – obviously jerks and dorks – will go to work every morning), drink for free, and they will also get free cash handouts when the party is over.

How do you like the Paulson plan?
