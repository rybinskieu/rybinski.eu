I believe that Asian common currency will be created, maybe sooner that most people would imagine today. I know there are many sceptics, including Pridiyathorn Devakula governor of the Thailand Central Bank (read his Reuters [comment](http://www.theedgedaily.com/cms/content.jsp?id=com.tms.cms.article.Article_c01151c5-cb73c03a-e8606c00-d22f0221)). But read an interesting article written by Joseph Yam, HKMA CEO, who [describes](http://www.info.gov.hk/hkma/eng/viewpt/20060713e.htm) the progress made by renminbi as convertible currency for border trade and plans for growing international role for renminbi.
