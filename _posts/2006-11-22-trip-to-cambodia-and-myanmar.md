I am starting my two-week holiday today and I am heading to Cambodia and Myanmar. I hope to share with my fellow bloggers the experience from this trip, and hopefully some pictures as well. I will be back on 7 December, so I will not be blogging/moderating comments until then.

Some bright Polish computer scientists (you probably know that Poland has best software engineers in the world, our IT students win most international competitions) are now working to make my knowledge base compatible with Web 2.0. I hope to have final results in December, and my blog will make this knowledge base available to all web surfers interested in topics covered by this blog.

I look forward to blog with you when I come back.

Best,

Krzysztof Rybinski
